# Deft-DEX
Deft Dex is a decentralized and secure AMM with uniform liquidity and variable LP fees. Deft Dex reimagines impermanent loss, converting it into a benefit for LPs. This innovative approach mitigates the full profit potential for arbitrageurs, ensuring benefits for LP even in volatile market conditions.
